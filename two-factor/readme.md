## Description ##

In order to better combat brute force login attempts and stolen passwords, WordPress needs a standardized-yet-extensible core system for providing opt-in Two-Factor Authentication to users.  This, hopefully, is that system.

We are aiming to be ready to merge in to Core in February of 2016, during the 4.5 release cycle.
